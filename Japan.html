        <h2>Places I find fascinating <img src ="http://clipart-library.com/data_images/102.jpg" alt ="heart" height = 25 width = 25> in Japan</h2>
        <section id = "love">
            <h3>Tokyo Tower</h3>
            <img class = "clearme" src ="http://songmoi.vn/sites/default/files/images2015/doisong/t4/tokyo_-_anh_2.jpg" alt ="tokyotower" height = 180 width = 150>
            <p class = "para">
                Did you know that the Tokyo tower is actually taller than the Eiffel tower? 
                Did you also know that the tower gets repainted every 5 years? 
                And apparently, they change its color on special occassions such as Christmas.
                Personally, I am a such fan of the Tokyo tower.
            </p>
            <h3>Meiji Shrine</h3>
            <img class = "clearme" src ="http://jbrish.com/wp-content/2016_pictures//japan_2015/Tokyo_6-4.jpg" alt="meiji" height = 180 width = 300>
            <p class = "para">
                This shrine hosts festivals throughout the year and is a very popular place.
                Many weddings also take place at this shrine. I witnessed one myself.
                Did you know that the Meiji shrine burned down during World War II?
                It was later rebuilt thanks to public donations.
            </p>
            <h3>Shibuya</h3>
            <img class = "clearme" src = "http://previews.123rf.com/images/sepavo/sepavo1301/sepavo130100024/17464672-TOKYO-DECEMBER-15-Shibuya-Crossing-December-15-2012-in-Tokyo-JP-The-crossing-is-one-of-the-world-s-m-Stock-Photo.jpg" alt ="shibuya" height = 190 width = 250>
            <p class = "para">
                It is known as the busiest intersection in the world. 
                This is a place where hundreds of people cross at a time.
                Especially on a Friday night, this place is packed with people.
                It's awesome!
            </p>
            <h3>Asakusa</h3>

            <p class = "para">
                Is it just me or are these temples absolutely stunning?
                This is actually a very famous Buddhist temple. 
                It is also the oldest temple of Tokyo.
