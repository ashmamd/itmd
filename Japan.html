                Did you know that the Meiji shrine was burned down during World War II?
                It was later rebuilt thanks to public donations.
                Here you can purify your hands and mouth from the communal water tank, 
                and write wishes on little pieces of paper and tie them on the prayer wall. 
                You can toss some money in the offering box as well. Bow your head twice, clap twice and bow once again.
                If you want to see a traditional Japanese wedding, go on a Sunday.
                At the opposite end of the shrine, there is an inner garden, which looks espicialy stunning in the summer.

                This statue was made for a dog who came to meet his owner after work at this station every day.
