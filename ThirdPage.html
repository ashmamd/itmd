    <ul>
        <li><b>CS100 with Michael Saelee</b></li>
        <li>The class gave us an overview of what future CS classes would look like. 
            Honestly, it scared the heck out of me as I was exposed to things I had never seen before.</li>
        <li><b>CS115 with Suman Saha</b></li>
        <li>This class was fairly easy because I had taken a CS course in high school. 
            However, I heard people had a hard time in this class.</li>
        <li><b>HUM200 with Katherine Thompson</b></li>
        <li>This class exposed me to America's history. 
            It taught me how the Irish, Japanese, Chinese, Mexicans and 
            people of different races came to the United States. It was a discussion filled class.</li>
        <li><b>SOC208 with Ullica Segerstrale</b></li>
        <li>This was a social psychology class and was an easy A.
            Learned a ton and the professor was very knowledgeable.</li>
        <li><b>MATH152 with Jesus Miranda</b></li>
        <li>I had a tough time with Calculus 2 however, this was an easy class as well.
            Professor Miranda was super nice and helpful.</li>
    </ul>
