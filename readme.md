This is the README file.

This is the first project of my ITMD class.
It includes a total of <i>four</i> html pages.
This is what a readme file looks like.
<ol>
  <li>An index.html which talks a little about me.</li>
  <li>A Resume.html that has my education and work experience information.</li>
  <li>A Japan.html that includes places I find fascinating.</li>
  <li>A BucketList.html that includes things I want to do and eat.</li>
</ol>
